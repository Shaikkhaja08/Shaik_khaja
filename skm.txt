C is one of the foundational programming languages used in the development of compilers, operating systems, and embedded systems where speed and efficiency matter.

It is considered the best language to start because it provides a strong understanding of fundamental coding concepts like data types, variables, loops, and functions.

With a competitive base salary, there is a significant demand for C developers in high-stake fields where high performance is essential.
